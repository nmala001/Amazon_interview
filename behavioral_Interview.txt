7. Why Amazon?

“I really believe the vision that making Amazon the Earth’s most customer-centric 
company more than anyone and I wanted to be a part of it on it’s pursuit 
which is the reason and motivation driving me to join Amazon.”

“The reason why I’m willing to join Amazon is how well I was treated when 
I raised a complaint which one wouldn’t be able to see in other e-commerce companies. 
It maybe a small thing but it was pretty magnificent on how Amazon takes little things seriously 
and I’m a guy of same trait which motivates me to join the workplace where I feel belonged.”
