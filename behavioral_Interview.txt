1. Disagreement with an employer? conflict at work

disagreed and (yet) committed.

Situation: It was during my work at Old dominion university. Looking at how the projects are managed and documented(barely no documentation at all) which made the life of a programmer a lot more difficult.
Task: I proposed a plan to implement an in house wiki where the work done by the individual is documented and a track of the project can be monitored
Action: The proposal was declined by my supervisor. At that point he thought that the need for such a tool is not at all necessary. 
Though I was not at all satisfied by the outcome of that discussion, I was still committed to the project and carried out the tasks assigned to me.  
Result: There was a time when most of the people working had to leave the organisation and the people responsible for their part of the work were not present there to explain the new individuals what exactly was happening. 
My manager realised the importance of having some sort of project management tool and the necessity of concrete documentation.

6. Situation where you worked under pressure?
Yes, I actually enjoy working under pressure, though I believe that proper planning and good time management will greatly reduce any alarming deadlines.

Situation: During my time at cognizant there was a time where I was given multiple responsibilities. I was both a trainee and also the batch representative. 
Task: I was assigned a task to give the timely reports of the progress of all the candidates apart from doing my own project(Completing the project in the given deadline).
Action: I came up with a plan of using the git hub repository. creating the repositories for individual teams and making my supervisor as the collaborator.
Result: This action reduced my burden a little bit of creating the reports. As the progress of individual team can be seen by the supervisor on the github. This also gave a solution to the problem of integrating each others code which reduced much important time given to integrate and find bugs after the integration.


7. Why Amazon?

“I really believe the vision that making Amazon the Earth’s most customer-centric 
company more than anyone and I wanted to be a part of it on it’s pursuit 
which is the reason and motivation driving me to join Amazon.”

“The reason why I’m willing to join Amazon is how well I was treated when 
I raised a complaint which one wouldn’t be able to see in other e-commerce companies. 
It maybe a small thing but it was pretty magnificent on how Amazon takes little things seriously 
and I’m a guy of same trait which motivates me to join the workplace where I feel belonged.”
